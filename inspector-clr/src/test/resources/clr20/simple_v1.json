Exercises include the identification of the cells and tissues and the body systems (skin, skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and urinary) as well as investigations in how those systems function. Lecture and discussions are complemented by labs involving microscopic studies, hands on discovery labs and some dissections. This class is for any junior or senior interested in the science of the human body; it also fulfills the science prerequisite to be accepted into Advanced Health Careers. This science course is not a requirement for the Nurse Assisting pathway."
